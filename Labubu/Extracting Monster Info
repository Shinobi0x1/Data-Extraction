Pagination with Selenium

In this project, I explored how to navigate through multiple pages using Selenium. I implemented pagination by using a for loop to iterate through a specified number of pages:

for page in range(0, 9):

This allowed the script to click through each page sequentially. Additionally, I incorporated a delay of 11 seconds to ensure that each page fully rendered before proceeding to the next one.

Key takeaways from this project:
✅ Using loops to automate multi-page navigation
✅ Implementing wait times to handle page rendering
✅ Gaining a deeper understanding of Selenium for dynamic web scraping
