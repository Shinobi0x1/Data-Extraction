In this project, I gained valuable experience in extracting data from Craigslist. I learned how to effectively navigate between pages and handle pagination, ensuring that data from each listing is accurately captured without losing context. One of the key challenges was managing the navigation back and forth between the listing pages and individual data pages. This led me to implement strategies such as extracting URL values from the homepage before navigating away, which helps avoid issues like stale element references. Overall, the project deepened my understanding of dynamic content handling, robust data extraction methods, and efficient pagination techniques.
